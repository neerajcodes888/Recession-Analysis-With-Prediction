## Introduction üåü
This project aims to analyze historical economic data to predict recessions using machine learning techniques. By leveraging various algorithms and statistical methods, we've developed a model that can forecast economic downturns with reasonable accuracy. Additionally, we've deployed this model for easy access and visualization.

## Current Economic Data 

#### Current Ecocnomic Data of India , Q1 2024

| Indicator        | Value (Latest)       |
|--------------------|----------------------|
| GDP                | $4.112 trillion      |
| Unemployment Rate  | 3.1%                 |
| Inflation Rate     | 5.1%                 |
| GDP Growth         | 6.1%                 |
| Exchange Rate      | 1 USD = 82.75 INR    |
| Forex Reserves     | $619.07 billion      |

### Description

- **GDP (Gross Domestic Product)**: The total monetary value of all goods and services produced within a country's borders in a specific time period, usually annually or quarterly. [Source: IMF]

- **Unemployment Rate**: The percentage of the labor force that is unemployed and actively seeking employment. It's a key indicator of economic health, reflecting the balance between job supply and demand. [Source: Economic Times]

- **Inflation Rate**: The rate at which the general level of prices for goods and services is rising, leading to a decrease in purchasing power over time. High inflation can erode the value of money. [Source: Forbes]

- **GDP Growth**: The percentage increase in GDP from one period to another. It indicates the pace at which the economy is expanding or contracting. [Source: IMF]

- **Exchange Rate**: The value of one currency in relation to another. It determines the purchasing power of a currency in international trade. [Source: Economic Times]

- **Forex Reserves (Foreign Exchange Reserves)**: The foreign currency deposits and bonds held by central banks and monetary authorities. They serve as a buffer to stabilize the domestic currency and ensure liquidity in the foreign exchange market. [Source: IMF]

## Future Scope üîç
The project has immense potential for expansion and improvement. Some future enhancements could include:
- Incorporating more sophisticated machine learning models for better predictions.
- Integrating real-time economic indicators for more accurate forecasts.
- Building a user-friendly web interface for easier interaction with the model.
- Expanding analysis to include regional or sector-specific recessions.

## Vision üöÄ
Vision is to provide policymakers, economists, and businesses with a reliable tool for anticipating recessions and making informed decisions to mitigate their impact. By harnessing the power of machine learning and data analysis, we strive to contribute to economic stability and resilience.
